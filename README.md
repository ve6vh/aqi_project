This repo contains file for the APRS over MQTT project AQI application. The aim of this project is to enable IOT sensor devices that use the MQTT protocol (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) to be able to post to APRS. 
This particular application uses devices that employ the Bosch BME680 sensor to gather Air Quality Index information. 
The project currently supports an Arduino R4 WiFi a standalone platform and sensor, other platforms will be rolled out in future.
